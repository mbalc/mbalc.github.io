my spotify profile: https://open.spotify.com/user/mbalc909?si=485c17ad338e49f1

my old last.fm I don't really use anymore:

instruments I play/know - guitar (electric/classical/acoustic/bass/whatever), I also attended 1st
degree music school where I played bassoon, I dream of learning oboe someday, would like to learn
some drums as well, I was looking around recently for some portable, improv-friendly wind
instrument, haven't decided on anything yet
